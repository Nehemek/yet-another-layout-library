# YALL - Yet Another Layout Library [for LÃ¶ve2D]
Welcome! Yall is a responsive layout library inspired by the [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) and [TailWindCSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## So what's so special about it compared to other libraries?
First Yall offers a robust flexbox engine which allows you to build user interfaces where elements can have fixed or relative sizes. Parents nodes will either grow or contain their children and you can mix and match to easily create spacers, floaters and more! See some examples:

## What YALL is not
Yall is not a widget, component or input library. Yall is only meant to help you position your elements around and adapt to any screen size. You are free to use any input method to drive your logic and examples are provided in the examples folder.
